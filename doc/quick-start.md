# Quick Start Guide
This page serves to quickly explain TheReposterminator so you can get it set up on your subreddit with ease.

---
Navigate to the moderators page of your subreddit, open the dialog to invite a new moderator, and invite u/TheReposterminator.

**For setting permissions:** Strictly speaking, you can add the bot with no permissions, and it will work more or less fine. However, there are 2 permissions that are recommended:
- `Manage Posts and Comments`
    <br>
    This permission allows TheReposterminator to remove its comments automatically, so only mods can see them.
- `Manage Wiki Pages`
    <br>
    This permission is necessary in order for configuration to work properly. Inviting TheReposterminator with this permission will allow the bot to automatically create a config page for you.

---
That's it - the bot begins indexing and scanning posts as soon as it's added to your subreddit.
    <br>
If so desired, you can tweak the configuration options (see the subreddit-config page for more info), but TheReposterminator implements sane defaults, so adjustment isn't crucial.
