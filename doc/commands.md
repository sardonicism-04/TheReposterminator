## Available Commands

`update`  
This command tells TheReposterminator to look at your subreddit's wiki page, and update your sub's config accordingly. You should run this command whenever you make changes to the configuration wiki page.  
TheReposterminator will reply with a confirmation if the configuration was updated successfully, and will let you know what went wrong if it failed.

`defaults`  
This command will reset the subreddit's config to its default values. If the subreddit does not have a config page when this command is executed, it will automatically be created. This is useful to create a config page on a subreddit that did not previously have one, or to reset the config to its default values after new configuration options are added.  
TheReposterminator will reply with a confirmation if the configuration was reset successfully, and will let you know what went wrong if it failed.
